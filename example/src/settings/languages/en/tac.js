It provides an additional layer of security and identity authentication before you are able to perform any tasks or transactions online. Each TAC will expire after 10 minutes or upon logout, whichever is earlier.<br/><br/>Just as long as you don't give away your TAC request code, rest assured that your online transactions are secured.",
